This project is written in Vue.js using [CoPilot](http://startvuejs.com/product/copilot/) as frontend Admin theme.<br>
It can light some [Philips Hue](https://www2.meethue.com) lamps using the [API](https://www.developers.meethue.com/).

It's terrible, but it shows a few things that can be reused like the rgb to xy colorspace.
